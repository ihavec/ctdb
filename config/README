This directory contains run-time support scripts for CTDB.

Selected highlights:

  ctdb.init

    An initscript for starting ctdbd at boot time.

  events.d/

    Eventscripts.  See events.d/README for more details.

  functions

    Support functions, sourced by eventscripts and other scripts.

  interface_modify.sh

    Script to support add/remove IPs and other funky stuff.  Not sure
    why this is separate... but it certainly allows easy wrapping by
    flock.

  statd-callout

    rpc.statd high-availability callout to support lock migration on
    failover.

Note that all of these scripts are written in POSIX Bourne shell.
Please avoid bash-isms, including the use of "local" variables (which
are not available in POSIX shell).

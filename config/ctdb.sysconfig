# there is no default

# the NODES file must be specified or ctdb won't start
# it should contain a list of IPs that ctdb will use

# CTDB_LOGFILE=/var/log/log.ctdb

# what debug level to run at. Higher means more verbose
# the default is 0
# CTDB_DEBUGLEVEL=0

# set any default tuning options for ctdb
# use CTDB_SET_XXXX=value where XXXX is the name of the tuning
# variable
# for example
#    CTDB_SET_TRAVERSETIMEOUT=60
# you can get a list of variables using "ctdb listvars"

onnode - run commands on ctdb nodes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 38
\fBonnode [OPTION] \.\.\. NODES COMMAND \.\.\.\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
onnode is a utility to run commands on a specific node of a CTDB cluster, or on all nodes\.
.PP
The NODES option specifies which node to run a command on\. You can specify a numeric node number (from 0 to N\-1) or a descriptive node specification (see DESCRIPTIVE NODE SPECIFICATIONS below)\. You can also specify lists of nodes, separated by commas, and ranges of numeric node numbers, separated by dashes\. If nodes are specified multiple times then the command will be executed multiple times on those nodes\. The order of nodes is significant\.
.PP
The COMMAND can be any shell command\. The onnode utility uses ssh or rsh to connect to the remote nodes and run the command\.

The following descriptive node specification can be used in place of numeric node numbers:

.fi
.RE
.PP

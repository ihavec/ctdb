.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
onnode is a utility to run commands on a specific node of a CTDB cluster, or on all nodes.
.PP
The NODE option specifies which node to run a command on. You can specify a numeric node number (from 0 to N\-1) or the special node 'all'.
.PP
The COMMAND can be any shell command. The onnode utility uses ssh or rsh to connect to the remote nodes and run the command.

If the COMMAND starts with a /, then the command is run via the 'at' service. Otherwise the command is run in the foreground.

  <refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      onnode is a utility to run commands on a specific node of a CTDB
      cluster, or on all nodes.
    </para>
    <para>
      The NODE option specifies which node to run a command on. You
      can specify a numeric node number (from 0 to N-1) or the special
      node 'all'.
    </para>
    <para>
      The COMMAND can be any shell command. The onnode utility uses
      ssh or rsh to connect to the remote nodes and run the command.
      </para>
    <para>
      If the COMMAND starts with a /, then the command is run via the
      'at' service. Otherwise the command is run in the foreground.
    </para>

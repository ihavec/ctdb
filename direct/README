Run ./direct/ctdbd.sh to start a cluster with two ctdb nodes
They will listen for clients on the unix domain sockets
/tmp/ctdb.socket.127.0.0.1
/tmp/ctdb.socket.127.0.0.2

In order for this to work you must have an interface with the address 127.0.0.2 available.
Just create this as an alias for loopback.


Then run ./direct/ctdbd_test to connect a client to the ctdbd daemon on /tmp/ctdb.socket.127.0.0.1 and do some commands to it across the domain socket.

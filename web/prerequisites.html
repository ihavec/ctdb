<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

Before you can start using CTDB you must first install and configure a bunch of linux boxes.<br><br>

After that you need to install and configure a cluster filesystem and mount that cluster filesystem on all the linux boxes that will form your cluster.<br><br>

We have primarily used the GPFS filesystem for our testing but any cluster filesystem should work as long as it provides correct file locking.<br>

<h1>Other cluster filesystems</h1>
While we primarily test with GPFS, CTDB should work with almost any other cluster filesystem as well.<br><br>
Please let us know your experiences in using other cluster filesystems.

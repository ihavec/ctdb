<H2 align="center">Getting the code</h2>

You need two source trees, one is a copy of Samba3 with clustering
patches, and the other is the ctdb code itself.<p>

Both source trees are stored in bzr repositories.<p>

See http://bazaar-vcs.org/ for more information on bzr.<p>

<h2>CTDB</h2>
To get an initial checkout of the ctdb code do this:
<pre>
   rsync -avz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/ctdb .
</pre>

To update this tree when improvements are made in the upstream code do this:
<pre>
    cd ctdb
    bzr merge http://samba.org/~tridge/ctdb
</pre>

If you don't have bzr and can't easily install it, then you can instead use the following command to update your tree to the latest version:
<pre>
    cd ctdb
    rsync -avz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/ctdb/ .
</pre>


<h2>Samba3 ctdb verion</h2>
The fastest way to checkout an initial copy of the Samba3 tree with clustering patches is:
<pre>
  rsync -avz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/samba_3_0_ctdb .
</pre>

To update this tree when improvements are made in the upstream code do this:
<pre>
   cd samba_3_0_ctdb
   bzr merge http://samba.org/~tridge/samba_3_0_ctdb
</pre>

If you don't have bzr and can't easily install it, then you can instead use the following command to update your tree to the latest version:
<pre>
    cd samba_3_0_ctdb
    rsync -avz samba.org::ftp/unpacked/samba_3_0_ctdb/ .
</pre>

<h2>Binary Packages</h2>

Note that packages are so far only available for RHEL4. Other packages
will come later. <p>

See <a href="packages/">packages</a> directory for package
downloads.

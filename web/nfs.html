<h1>Setting up clustered NFS</h1>

<h2>Prereqs</h2>
Configure CTDB as above and set it up to use public ipaddresses.<br>
Verify that the CTDB cluster works.

<h2>sm-notify</h2>

Make sure you have the sm-notify tool installed in /usr/sbin.<br>
You should find that tool in the nfs-util package for your operating system.<br><br>
This tool is required so that CTDB will be able to successfully trigger lock recovery after an ip address failover/failback.<br><br>
This tool must be installed as /usr/sbin/sm-notify on all nodes in the cluster.

<h2>/etc/exports</h2>

Export the same directory from all nodes.<br>
Make sure to specify the fsid export option so that all nodes will present the same fsid to clients.<br>

Clients can get "upset" if the fsid on a mount suddenly changes.<br>
Example /etc/exports :
<pre>
  /gpfs0/data *(rw,fsid=1235)
</pre>

<h2>/etc/sysconfig/nfs</h2>

This file must be edited to point statd to keep its state directory on 
shared storage instead of in a local directory.<br><br>

We must also make statd use a fixed port to listen on that is the same for 
all nodes in the cluster.<br>

If we don't specify a fixed port, the statd port will change during failover 
which causes problems on some clients.<br>
(some clients are very slow to realize when the port has changed)<br><br>

This file should look something like :
<pre>
  CTDB_MANAGES_NFS=yes
  CTDB_MANAGES_NFSLOCK=yes
  STATD_SHARED_DIRECTORY=/gpfs0/nfs-state
  STATD_HOSTNAME=\"ctdb -P $STATD_SHARED_DIRECTORY/192.168.1.1 -H /etc/ctdb/statd-callout -p 97\"
</pre>

The CTDB_MANAGES_NFS line tells the events scripts that CTDB is to manage startup and shutdown of the NFS and NFSLOCK services.<br>

The CTDB_MANAGES_NFSLOCK line tells the events scripts that CTDB is also to manage the nfs lock manager.<br>

With these set to yes, CTDB will start/stop/restart these services as required.<br><br>

STATD_SHARED_DIRECTORY is the shared directory where statd and the statd-callout script expects that the state variables and lists of clients to notify are found.<br>

This directory must be stored on the shared cluster filesystem so that all nodes can access the same data.<br><br>

Don't forget to create this directory:
<pre>
  mkdir /gpfs0/nfs-state
</pre>


<h2>chkconfig</h2>

Since CTDB will manage and start/stop/restart the nfs and the nfslock services, you must disable them using chkconfig.
<pre>
  chkconfig nfs off
  chkconfig nfslock off
</pre>


<h2>Event scripts</h2>

CTDB clustering for NFS relies on two event scripts /etc/ctdb/events.d/nfs and /etc/ctdb/events.d/nfslock.<br>

These two scripts are provided by the RPM package and there should not be any need to change them.

<h2><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></h2>

Never ever mount the same nfs share on a client from two different nodes in the cluster at the same time!<br><br>

The client side caching in NFS is very fragile and assumes/relies on that an object can only be accessed through one single path at a time.

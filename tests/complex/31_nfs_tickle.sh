Verify that NFS connections are monitored and that NFS tickles are sent.

We create a connection to the NFS server on a node and confirm that
this connection is registered in the nfs-tickles/ subdirectory in
shared storage.  Then disable the relevant NFS server node and ensure
that it send an appropriate reset packet.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 nodes with public addresses.

* Test must be run on a real or virtual cluster rather than against
  local daemons.

* Test must not be run from a cluster node.

* Cluster nodes must be listening on the NFS TCP port (2049).

Steps:

1. Verify that the cluster is healthy.
2. Connect from the current host (test client) to TCP port 2049 using
   the public address of a cluster node.
3. Determine the source socket used for the connection.
4. Ensure that CTDB records the source socket details in the nfs-tickles
   directory on shared storage.
5. Disable the node that the connection has been made to.
6. Verify that a TCP tickle (a reset packet) is sent to the test client.

Expected results:

* CTDB should correctly record the socket in the nfs-tickles directory
  and should send a reset packet when the node is disabled.

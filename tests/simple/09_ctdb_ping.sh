Verify the operation of the 'ctdb ping' command.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. Run the 'ctdb ping' command on one of the nodes and verify that it
   shows valid and expected output. 
3. Shutdown one of the cluster nodes, using the 'ctdb shutdown'
   command. 
4. Run the 'ctdb ping -n <node>' command from another node to this
   node. 
5. Verify that the command is not successful since th ctdb daemon is
   not running on the node.

Expected results:

* The 'ctdb ping' command shows valid and expected output.

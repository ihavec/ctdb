Verify the operation of the 'ctdb ban' command.

This is a superficial test of the 'ctdb ban' command.  It trusts
information from CTDB that indicates that the IP failover has
happened correctly.  Another test should check that the failover
has actually happened at the networking level.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. Ban one of the nodes using the 'ctdb ban <timeout>' command.
3. Before the ban timeout expires, verify that the status of the
   node changes to 'banned'.
4. Verify that the public IP addresses that were being served by
   the node are failed over to one of the other nodes.
5. When the ban expires ensure that the status of the node changes
   back to 'OK' and that the public IP addresses move back to the
   node.

Expected results:

* The status of the banned nodes changes as expected and IP addresses
  failover as expected.

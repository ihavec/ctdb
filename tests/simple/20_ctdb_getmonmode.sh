Verify 'ctdb getmonmode' works correctly.

This test doesn't actually verify that enabling and disabling
monitoring mode actually does that.  It trusts ctdb that the
monitoring mode is modified as requested.  21_ctdb_disablemonitor.sh
does some more useful checking.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. Use 'ctdb getmodmode -n <node>' to get the current monitoring mode.
3. Verify that it shows monitoring as 'active'.
4. Verify that the command prints the output in colon-separated format
   when run with the '-Y' option.
5. Disable monitoring on the node using 'ctdb disablemonitor'.
6. Verify that it shows monitoring as 'disabled'.

Expected results:

* 'ctdb getmonmode' works as expected.

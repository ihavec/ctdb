Verify that 'ctdb disablemonitor' works correctly.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.
* 00_ctdb_install_eventscript.sh successfully installed its event
  script.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. Create a file called /tmp/ctdb-test-unhealthy-trigger.<node> on a
   node and verify that the status of the node changes to unhealthy
   within the interval indicated by the MonitorInterval variable.
3. Check that the file /tmp/ctdb-test-unhealthy-detected.<node> is
   created, indicating that the event script is the reason the node
   has been marked as unhealthy.
4. Now disable monitoring on the node using 'ctdb disablemonitor -n <node>.
5. Verify that the message 'Monitoring mode:DISABLED' is printed.
6. Remove /tmp/ctdb-test-unhealthy-detected.<node> and ensure that it
   is not recreated within the interval indicated by the
   MonitorInterval variable.
7. Remove /tmp/ctdb-test-unhealthy-trigger.<node>.
8. Verify that the status of the node continues to be 'UNHEALTHY',
   since monitoring has been disabled.

Expected results:

* When monitoring is disabled, event scripts are not executed and the
  state of nodes is not monitored.

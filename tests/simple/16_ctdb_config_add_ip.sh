Verify that an IP address can be added to a node using 'ctdb addip'.

This test goes to some trouble to figure out which IP address to add
but assumes a 24-bit subnet mask.  It does not handle IPv6.  It does
not do any network level checks that the new IP address is reachable
but simply trusts 'ctdb ip' that the address has been added.  There is
also an extra prerequisite that the node being added to already has
public addresses - this is difficult to avoid if the extra address is
to be sensibly chosen.

Prerequisites:

* An active CTDB cluster with at least 2 active nodes.

Steps:

1. Verify that the status on all of the ctdb nodes is 'OK'.
2. Use 'ctdb ip' on one of the nodes to list the IP addresses being
   served.
3. Add an additional public address to be served by the node, using
   'ctdb addip'.
4. Verify that this IP address has been added to the list of IP
   addresses being served by the node, using the 'ctdb ip' command.

Expected results:

* 'ctdb ip' adds an IP address to the list of public IP addresses
  being served by a node.
